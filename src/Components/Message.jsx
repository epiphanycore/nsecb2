        <h1>MESSAGE FROM CHAIRMAN, CEIE</h1>
        <p> It is my great pleasure to welcome you to the International Conference on Advances in Chemical and Material Sciences (ACMS-2026). After the resounding success of ACMS-2022, we are thrilled to bring together the global scientific community once again to share knowledge, exchange ideas, and showcase the latest advancements in Chemical and Materials Science.

The theme of ACMS-2026 is aptly focused on bridging the gap between academia and industry, and we have carefully curated a program that will facilitate meaningful interactions between scientists, researchers, and industrialists. Our conference will feature a diverse range of topics, including cutting-edge research, innovative technologies, and sustainable solutions.

ACMS-2026 aims to provide a platform for the global community to come together, share their experiences, and learn from each other. We believe that this conference will not only facilitate the exchange of knowledge but also foster collaborations, inspire new ideas, and drive innovation in the field of Chemical and Materials Science.

We are thrilled to announce that ACMS-2026 will be a premier event of the Centre for Education Innovation and Entrepreneurship (CEIE), highlighting our commitment to innovation and excellence.

I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to our keynote speakers, technical committee members, and sponsors for their support and contributions to ACMS-2026.
